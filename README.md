## Pomodoro Crush

**What is Pomodoro Crush?** 

Pomodoro Crush is a gamified productivity tool meant for crushing larger tasks into oblivion. It takes the focus of the pomodoro app, drizzles in the simple organization a todo-list provides, and bakes it all into a sweet gamified experience that is all at once simple, impactful, yet lip-smackingly palatable. 

In other words, it's a hybrid Pomodoro/Todo App made in Create React App.

**How does one unleash the power of Pomodoro Crush?**

Create tasks and decide how much time (Pomodori) you would like to apply to that task. Then run the timer when you are focusing on that task. Do not allow yourself to lose focus for this session (default 25mins). This app excels at organizing and managing larger tasks that need to be broken down into shorter sessions (coding, writing, research, administrative tasks, etc...) while allowing the user to focus  on their work, thus improving the quality. 

**What makes Pomodoro Crush Different?**

It'd be easy to write off Pom Crush as just another Pomodoro app, or just another todo app. But Pomodoro Crush merges the benefits of both productivity tools and combines them into a single gamified system. Pomodoro Crush allows the user to set their tasks for their day, then apply time and work to those tasks until they are vanquished to the dark, empty voids of oblivion (...it counts down instead of up). 

The mini-game system of the app rewards the user for finishing all the tasks for the day, and punishes them for leaving tasks uncompleleted.
